# App Store Plugin for KOReader

Discover, install, and update community-created KOReader plugins and user patches without leaving your device. The AppStore plugin searches both GitHub topics (`koreader-plugin`, `koreader-user-patch`) and repositories whose names follow patterns like `"KOReader.patches"` or `"[NAME].plugins"`. The plugin supports standard owner/topic/description filters, surfacing curated lists with filtering, sorting, and hands-on install flows that feel native on e-ink hardware.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unified browser** for both plugins and user patches with persistent filters and paging.
- **Offline-friendly cache** stored under `data/cache/AppStore` so existing results remain accessible when you lose connectivity.
- **Per-entry README viewer** that fetches `README.md` directly from GitHub and opens it in KOReader’s document renderer.
- **Install/update pipeline** that handles `.koplugin` archives, verifies metadata, and copies files to `data/plugins` or `data/patches` accordingly.
- **Update tracking** for installed plugins and numbered patch files, complete with SHA comparisons and refreshable summaries.
- **Optional authentication** through a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to increase API rate limits.

## Requirements

1. KOReader nightly or 2024.12+ with LuaSocket, Archiver, SHA2, and SQLite dependencies (bundled in default releases).
2. Network connectivity for refreshing caches, fetching README files, and downloading plugin or patch archives.
3. (Optional) A GitHub PAT with `public_repo` scope to avoid unauthenticated rate limits (~10 requests/minute shared across the device).

## Configuration (GitHub PAT)

If you routinely browse many repositories or hit rate-limit warnings, supply a PAT in `plugins/appstore.koplugin/appstore_configuration.lua`:

```lua
return {
    auth = {
        github = {
            type = "github",
            token = "ghp_your_token_here",
        },
    },
}
```

### How to create a GitHub PAT

1. Sign in at [github.com](https://github.com/) and open **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Fine-grained tokens** (or **Tokens (classic)**), You can follow [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Name the token (e.g., `KOReader AppStore`), set an expiration, and grant at least the **`public_repo`** scope.
4. Generate and copy the token immediately—GitHub will not show it again.
5. Paste it into `appstore_configuration.lua` (You can create that file from `appstore_configuration.sample.lua`) and restart KOReader.

The plugin automatically includes the token in GitHub API requests, raising your quota to the standard authenticated limits.

## Navigating the Four AppStore Sections

The UI is built around four dedicated dialogs.

1. ### Plugins Browser (`App Store · Plugins`)
   - Lists repositories tagged as KOReader plugins.
   - Actions per entry: **Install / Update / Remove**, **View README**, open detail dialogs with description, stars, last updated timestamp, and repo owner.
   - Toolbar actions: switch to patches tab, refresh cache, adjust filters (`search text`, `owner`, `minimum stars`), change sorting (stars desc/asc, updated, name), and jump into the plugin update summary.

2. ### Patches Browser (`App Store · Patches`)
   - Lists repositories tagged as KOReader user patches and enumerates files matching `^[number]-*.lua`.
   - Actions per patch: **Install patch**, retry downloads, or open the repo README for full instructions.
   - Toolbar actions: mirror the plugin tab plus shortcuts to the patch update summary and a "matching patch" banner when reconciling installed files with remote entries.

3. ### Plugin Updates Dialog
   - Summarizes every installed plugin tracked by the AppStore cache.
   - Actions: **Check all updates**, toggle between “Only outdated” and “Show all plugins,” and jump straight back to the Plugins browser.
   - Each row shows the local version, cached remote version/SHA, last checked timestamp, and provides **Update** or **Reinstall** buttons when differences are detected.

4. ### Patch Updates Dialog
   - Works just like the plugin updates view but focuses on numbered patch files under `data/patches`.
   - Actions: **Refresh patch summary**, toggle filters, return to the Patches browser, or drill into individual patch entries to reinstall/overwrite when the remote SHA changes.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Open** KOReader → **Tools** → **App Store**.
2. Pick **Plugins** or **Patches** tab. Use the filter dialog to narrow by owner, name, topics, or star threshold.
3. Tap an entry for a quick action menu. Choosing **Install** downloads the repo ZIP (`/zipball/<ref>`), extracts it to a temp folder, validates `_meta.lua`, then copies it to `data/plugins/<name>.koplugin`.
4. After installation, KOReader prompts for a restart so the new plugin becomes available in the Tools menu.
5. For patches, selecting an item downloads the raw `.lua` file from the default branch and stores it under `data/patches/` while retaining the numbered filename used for KOReader’s patch loader.
6. Return anytime to the Updates dialogs to check for newer commits. The plugin compares cached SHAs with the installed files and highlights items needing attention.
7. Use **View README** to fetch the upstream documentation and open it in KOReader’s file viewer. Files are cached under `data/cache/appstore/readme/owner_repo_README.md` for offline rereads.

## Cache & Offline Behavior

- Repository metadata is stored in SQLite under `data/cache/appstore.db` (automatically created).
- The browser always reads from the cache first, keeping scrolling smooth even when the network is slow.
- When cached data is older than 7 days, the banner reminds you to trigger **Refresh cache**.
- README files, download archives, and installed SHAs are cached so subsequent operations reuse existing data whenever possible.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate limit exceeded | Anonymous GitHub quota exhausted | Configure a PAT and retry after a few minutes |
| Missing README | Repo lacks `README.md` or request failed | Confirm file exists upstream, then rerun **View README** while online |
| Patch not listed | Repository is not named `KOReader.patches` (or similar) and/or the `koreader-user-patch` topic is missing | Ask the maintainer to add the correct topic |
